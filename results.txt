She makes the whole flock move along.
In any rough place where it caught.
As may be in dark woods, and with a song
Between two days, the reason why I sought
A sordid peace or an outrageous war.
The road is forlorn all day,
Where they could ripen safely to the eating.

So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,

For that bright hope at last
